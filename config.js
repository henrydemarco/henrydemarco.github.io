            description: 'This website is a collaborative oral history of one unhoused movement and community in Berkeley — its goals, its achievements, and its enduring legacy. The history includes photographs, interviews, locations, and information gathered from countless conversations, archives, and existing writings. This cohesive narrative only exists because of the trust, generosity, and kindness of those whose stories it features. Without the contributions of project participants, this website could never have been assembled. <br> <br> Berkeley, 94700 was funded and supported by the Judith Lee Stronach Baccalaureate Prize and  <a href="https://metrostudies.berkeley.edu/featured-research/berkeley-lab-speculative-urbanisms" target="_blank" style="color: blue">the Berkeley Lab for Speculative Urbanisms.</a> Judith Lee Stronach was an artist, poet, journalist, educator and tireless advocate for the unhoused, and thus the Stronach prize supports intellectual and creative pursuits that <a href="https://stronach.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" style="color: blue"> heighten awareness of issues of social consciousness and contribute to the public good.</a> We were advised by Professor Brandi T. Summers and Professor Desiree Fields under The Berkeley Lab for Speculative Urbanisms, a social science venture combining expertise from fields including sociology, geography, global metropolitan studies, and more. We are honored to receive funding and guidance from the lab. <br> <br>  <a href="https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2017/01/02/18795056.php" target="_blank" style="color: blue">First They Came for the Homeless</a> is an unhoused protest movement that formed in 2011, in the wake of San Francisco Occupy. The group coalesced to protest the criminalization of homelessness in the Bay Area and to fight for better outcomes for the unhoused. The organization is notable for its commitment to self-led unhoused activism, as the founding members believed that those best suited to advocate for the homeless are the homeless themselves.',
            description2: 'Throughout its decade-long history, the group collaborated with several other like-minded organizations and gained not only intense media attention, but also many community supporters. Since arriving in Berkeley, FTCFTH has staged a continuous, 8-year long occupation to highlight the cruel treatment of the unhoused and to bring together a community in mutual support. The group has also kept its broader political commitments from Occupy, including protesting “income inequality and the privatization of the commons in the United States.” <br> <br> FTCFTH formed the Here There camp, one of — if not <i>the</i> — longest running encampment in the Bay Area. The camp is self-governing, sober, consensus-driven, and seeks to provide proof that sanctioned encampments can thrive. Numerous former residents of the camp credit it with bringing them greater stability and helping them move towards better outcomes, including sustainable housing. The camp remains active to this day, near the intersection of Alcatraz and Adeline, in Berkeley’s historic Lorin District. <br> <br> We chose to title this project ‘Berkeley, 94700,’ because it is a zip code that does not exist (Berkeley has twelve zip codes, beginning with 94701). Our animating interest in this project was how an unhoused camp exists as a neighborhood: a community of mutual aid, resource provisioning, and connection. Unlike housed neighborhoods, however, encampments cannot rely on the routine services that make a place <i>official</i>. Chief among these is mail delivery: to have an address is to be acknowledged, and to lack one is necessarily to be <i>unaddressed</i>. We imagine the Here There camp as a community with an invented zip code within Berkeley, which points towards its real existence as a place, as well as its lack of official geographic acknowledgement. <br> <br> We decided to format this website using a dynamic map, because we believe the story told here is essentially a geographic one. This story is organized around places on this map: significant locations where key aspects of the movement’s history took place. The goal here is to put the movement and the camp <i>on the map</i>, as unhoused communities are conspicuously absent from official cartography, even when they remain in the same place for years.',

Cities across the country were in the midst of the same tumult –– citizens were angry about the corruption, the recession, the foreclosures, and the crippling debt. Tent cities bloomed quickly and they offered shelter, food, and porta potties. In a city notable for its numerous anti-homeless laws, Occupy San Francisco was a respite for its unhoused, as well as an opportunity to make change.',

To James, Mike Zint was a “true hero,” a captain of Occupy who honed his skills as a political strategist and activist in one of the most zealous occupations in the country. James remembers Occupy SF as a concerted battle against the Federal Reserve and the manifold abuses of the American financial system. James is a photographer and documentarian, and he captured the intensity and possibility of Occupy firsthand. Through Occupy, participants created an organic, living alternative to the totalizing capitalist systems that defined American life. Occupiers also formed connections and lasting bonds: James, Mike, and Stacey Hill (Bay Area native and lifelong activist) would go on to collaborate on future projects after coming together at Occupy SF. For the duration of these occupations, activists carved out spaces for  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=lsxjl8HA2bQ" target="_blank" style="color: blue">protest and experimental living</a> in the administrative centers of capitalist repression, places like Wall Street and San Francisco’s Financial District.

Occupy Oakland was a massive movement with tens of thousands of participants, and its own distinct forms of radical, anti-capitalist politics. There was also Occupy Berkeley, which was much smaller — about 100 tents in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park constituted its main encampment. Occupy Cal was UC Berkeley’s own campus-driven movement, more concerned about the labor inequalities affecting the education system. Even San Jose had its own Occupy. Occupy Oakland converged with First They Came for the Homeless in dramatic fashion in the years following the (approximate) end of the Occupy movement, when multiple groups came together to protest the proposed sale of the historic Berkeley Main Post Office. <br> <br> “What I remember is that there were people in tents that were occupying the Post Office building: it was an attempt to keep the powers that be from selling that historic building and closing down the Post Office,” says Tony Wilkinson, local activist, community organizer, and member of Friends of Adeline. “There was a community group that was trying to hold on to it. But First They Came For The Homeless, which came out of Occupy — they had a social view of what people are up against, the need for collective action, a way to begin to challenge systemically or aggressively the right to define where you are gonna go and how you’re gonna live, and help to stabilize people.”',

            description: 'On June 25, 2012, <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2012/06/25/postal-service-plans-sale-of-berkeleys-main-post-office" target="_blank" style="color: blue"> Berkeleyside reported </a> that the United States Postal Service was planning to sell the historic Berkeley Main Post Office on Allston Way. USPS intended to shift core responsibilities to the existing Berkeley Destination Delivery Unit, and pursue a new location in downtown Berkeley for retail operations. Around the same time, USPS had listed dozens of historic post offices for sale, citing operating deficits. Despite the concerted efforts of local groups across the country, several historic post offices had already been sold. The prospects of protecting Berkeley’s Main Post Office looked grim, especially given the fact that the planned sale was being categorized as “relocation” as opposed to “closure,” which further limited legal possibilities for halting the process. When the Berkeley public learned of the Postal Service’s intentions, an organization called Save the Berkeley Post Office quickly formed to resist the planned sale. In February of 2013, when USPS representatives met with the Berkeley public regarding the planned sale, they encountered an outpouring of public resistance, including a large rally. The Berkeley City Council also passed a resolution in March of 2013 calling on USPS to postpone the sale for a year. A year later, USPS announced that they were moving forward with the sale. <br> <br> By May, several of the groups involved in efforts to protect the Post Office, and resist privatization more broadly, came together to form a coalition called the Berkeley Post Office Defenders (BPOD: pronounced bee-pod). The group’s members included members of Strike Debt Bay Area, Occupy Oakland, and Save the Berkeley Post Office. The coalition announced their <a href="https://strike-debt-bay-area.tumblr.com/post/56520032739/block-privatization-of-the-post-office" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Direct Defense of the Berkeley Post Office</a> on July 26, 2013. Protesters from the coalition set up information tables and tents at the Post Office, inviting the public to engage in dialogue. For those involved in the resistance, what was at stake extended far beyond one post office: this was about combating austerity, about refusing to sit idly while public resources were shorn away in the name of ‘cutting operational costs.’ Many worried that these sorts of sell-offs would constitute the start of the privatization of the US Postal Service. BPOD’s timeline was explicit from the start: the protest would end when the sale was reversed, and no earlier.',

Soon, others joined in. His group was an early incarnation of First They Came for the Homeless, and its first organized action since its inception in 2011. The Downtown Berkeley Staples was part of a pilot program to offload USPS duties to Staples, another corner cut in the sweeping austerity of the Obama administration. If successful, the program could enable USPS to cut costs by passing off key responsibilities to Staples workers, whose undervalued labor was more cost-effective than that of unionized postal workers. The Staples occupation existed as a 24/7 protest against the pilot program, as well as a way to further inform the public of the plan to sell the post office on Allston Way. <br> <br> During Mike Zint’s time outside the Shattuck Avenue Staples, he met like-minded organizers involved in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIaj8kK9Wyw" target="_blank" style="color: blue">ongoing post office defense</a>. BPOD’s mission aligned with that of FTCFTH, so collaboration between the two groups came naturally. Zint’s camp moved to the Main Post Office at Allston Way to contribute to the defense through an occupation — Mike’s specialty. The sale was still set to proceed in 2014, so that November, BPOD and FTCFTH began an active, prolonged camp in the spirit of Occupy, drawing in homeless activists and calling on former Occupiers. And, as with previous occupations, their residency was a prime opportunity to highlight the criminalization of homelessness more broadly. Tents provided not only shelter — they were also a technique of public assembly.',

The City of Berkeley took USPS to court in 2015, a measure to stop the relocation of its services (and the first step of a sale), but the case was dismissed. Then, in 2016, USPS brought suit against the City of Berkeley, claiming that those 2014 zoning changes were unconstitutional. All the while, BPOD and FTCFTH continued their occupation.

Two years later, the trial over Berkeley’s zoning changes began.

People had been holding vigil outside Old City Hall since 6 a.m. on Monday, fasting and <a href="https://abc7news.com/protesters-at-berkeley-city-hall-protest-against-laws-homeless-war-on-poor/1089296/" target="_blank" style="color: blue">“sleeping out”</a> in solidarity with the homeless. The camp was a new venture of FTCFTH, occurring concurrently with the ongoing Post Office Occupation. They called themselves Liberty City. 30 people had marched from Liberty City to Longfellow Middle School, where they joined a queue of people waiting their turn at a microphone. That night, Vice Mayor Linda Maio was bringing forth Item 28, a proposal to “Improve Conditions on our Community Sidewalks.” If instituted, the ordinances would prohibit people from having more than two square feet of personal possessions on sidewalks from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Not two-by-two square feet, but <i> two square feet </i>. Item 28 would also outlaw laying down inside planter beds or on planter walls. Those with shopping carts would be forced to move belongings to a new block every hour, and those who failed to comply with these restrictions could face a steep fine. <br> <br> One notable inclusion in the proposal was an ordinance prohibiting public urination and defecation, crimes that were already well established in county and statewide code. These additions were entirely redundant — the statewide code against public urination was enacted in 1872. Homeless advocates speculated that their inclusion was meant to bolster popular support for the proposal and discredit detractors. By including these restrictions in the proposal, supporters could make homeless advocates working to block the action appear to be acting in favor of allowing public defecation and urination. By manipulating optics in this manner, supporters of the proposal could shift the conversation away from the material concerns of unhoused people (such as the <a href="https://berkeley.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=715bb83772db4b85b64c44fc5dbce21f&extent=-122.3410,37.8350,-122.2143,37.8973" target="_blank" style="color: blue">severe lack of public bathrooms</a> in Berkeley) and towards more general, popular appeals to public ‘cleanliness.’ The new ordinances would be enforced upon the installation of an alternative storage option: 50 lockers, for Berkeley’s unhoused population of nearly 1,000. The total estimated cost of implementing the ordinances came up to $300,000 per year. After four hours of fervent testimony from the public, the council held a preliminary vote at 12:30 am. They voted to pass, 6-3.',

The auditorium of Longfellow Middle School was crowded, and as the night wore on, the energy became volatile. Maio grew increasingly impatient with the dissenting citizens. A vote to extend the meeting to 11:30 p.m. did not pass, and Councilman Kriss Worthington had the floor. Maio interrupted, accusing him of running down the clock to avoid a vote. This brought the crowd to a fever pitch. <br> <br> A member of the crowd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkZxqth8zeM&feature=emb_title" target="_blank" style="color: blue">took to the mic</a>. “It is a violation of the California Brown Act, to deny people the right to speak,” JP Massar said, citing the legislation that ensures citizens their right to participate in local governments. Maio continued to speak over him, calling for a vote. Massar then repeated his mantra. “You have the right to clear the room, but you do not have the right to deny people the right to speak,” he said, his voice bellowing over the soundsystem. The council passed the ordinance. Berkeley police evicted the residents of Liberty City three days later. <br> <br> Maio’s ordinance was adopted, but the policy was not enforced because the proposed lockers had not been made available. Providing lockers was the responsibility of the City Manager – to some, this fallthrough suggests that perhaps the City Council passed this ordinance only under pressure and in the heat of the moment. Another possibility is that the ordinance was simply too broad to allow for effective enforcement: constantly policing the exact geometric bounds of every unhoused person’s possessions in Berkeley is a massive, costly, and ultimately impossible project.',

Places could often get people in on their day of need, and you could call around and find someone who might fit you in. It was more of a human configuration: one developed friendly relationships with intake people at various places and they were a familiar face willing to help out when someone needed a bed for a night. But the coordinated entry system changed all of this.',
                description2: 'Dan, who was previously unhoused himself, had been planning various sleep outs with unhoused people for years as a means of protest, community building, and respite. He was an organizer of ‘Arnieville,’ a 2010 protest against Arnold Schwarzenegger’s proposal to slash funding for in-house disability services. Arnieville would go on for a month, making it one of the longest-lasting disability rights protests in US history, according to <a href="https://thestreetspirit.org/2010/08/01/the-message-of-arnieville-lives-on/" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Street Spirit</a>. He founded the Disabled People Outside Project to address these kinds of injustices –– he runs the project to this day. For years, he stockpiled tents, stoves, and other equipment necessary for outdoor living, which he planned to use to support a longer, more mobile sleep-out. What he saw at the Hub left him angry, and gave him the extra push he needed to work towards a vision he’d been brewing for years.',

Dan, Mike, Sarah Menafee, James Cartmill, and Michelle Lot met at Starbucks to discuss strategy and locations, and soon, The Poor Tour began in earnest. Their first stop was the Hub. The group made their camp as visible as possible, displaying signs with slogans like “Snubbed by the Hub!” There, others joined the group, growing its strength and numbers. “Not too long after I joined the encampment, we were raided by the police,” says Benjamin Royer, a disabled member of FTCFTH. “And then we kind of went on to what was called The Poor Tour. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ueC-qqTWXrs" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Police raid after police raid after police raid</a>.” The eviction at the Hub was the first of many.',

FTCFTH settled in the Lorin District, a historically non-white community in South Berkeley, setting up a camp near the sculpture on Adeline Street. That camp would come to be known by the same name as the sculpture: Here There.

                description: 'Before European colonization, the Chochenyo speaking Ohlone people lived on the Huichin territory we now know as Berkeley. In 1820, Luís María Peralta, a sergeant of the Spanish Army and an administrator of Native American erasure, received a land grant of 44,800 acres from California’s last Spanish Governor, Pablo Vicente de Solá. The Peralta Grant —one of the largest Spanish land grants— was a gift in recognition of the soldier’s years of long service guarding missions, fighting Native Americans, and keeping ledgers of cattle. The grant stretched from the El Cerrito Creek to the San Leandro Creek, which encompasses six and a half cities today, including Berkeley. From 1769 to 1821, California was a Spanish colony, and Peralta’s land grant was one of around twenty land grants made to individuals. <br> <br> California then became an independent nation of Mexico from 1821 to 1846. During this time, Mexico issued some six to eight hundred grants. By the time California was transferred to the United States in 1848, the legal claims to land held by rancheros like the Peraltas were tenuous. The same year, gold was discovered in the Sierras. New neighbors, squatters, cattle rustlers, and developers were hungry to settle, and new laws made it easier to lay claim to the Peraltas’ land. Newcomers flooded through Oakland on the newly completed Transcontinental Railroad. The family fought squatters all the way to the Supreme Court, but legal fees forced the Peraltas to sell more land; by 1877, they had lost almost all of the original 44,800 acres. ',

The original application, attached below, curiously features the name “Garfield" crossed out and replaced with “Lorin.” Who replaced the original “Garfield” remains a mystery with much speculation.',

The Great Migration is one of the largest movements of any group in American history, and can be understood in two waves. The First Great Migration (1910-1940) was a relocation to the north and midwest; as industrial jobs were left vacant during the first world war, Black populations joined the non-agricultural labor force. Although migrants moved to escape from racial violence, they were met with similar racism in their new communities, from white people who were furious with the changing demographics. In the Second Great Migration (1940-1970), people moved further north, but also west. Black people who migrated after World War II were met with organized pushback from the white localities, who were implementing discriminatory and segregationist practices.',

Grove Street had been understood in this city as an unofficial line of segregation, but New Deal era loaning practices had made such a line <i>official</i>. Under Roosevelt, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created to provide affordable mortgages in the wake of the Depression. HOLC needed to assure banks, however, that borrowers would not default. The organization drew up lending security maps of major American cities, supposedly for banks to assess lending risks. In reality, the maps produced were informed by the demographics of different neighborhoods, with the various ‘grades’ being encoded with an area’s racial makeup. The maps separated cities into four grades: A as “best,” B as “desirable,” C as “declining,” and D as “hazardous.” The best areas were green, the most hazardous areas were red. <br> <br> In Berkeley, MLK Jr. Way was the line that divided the red from the rest. Redlining inscribed racist notions in space, classifying non-white neighborhoods as ‘hazardous’ and effectively legalizing discriminatory lending practices. Redlining was only one of many legal and financial implements that contributed to segregation in US cities and produced geographies of difference in which non-white residents were exploited, denied services, and shut out of opportunities for wealth creation. This is the necessary context for understanding Lorin, a vibrant, historically non-white community that lay south of the literal red line that was once Grove Street.',

Many newly settled Black Berkeleyans worked in shipyards in Richmond as part of the burgeoning wartime defense industry. White property owners in Berkeley worked tirelessly to exclude the city’s non-white residents from housing opportunities, petitioning the city council to implement racial zoning laws. The Berkeley Realty Board was a favorite instrument of financial discrimination: the board supported the creation of neighborhood covenants that excluded would-be non-white home buyers, particularly Black and Asian people. Also worth noting is that Berkeley was the birthplace of single-family zoning, a practice that began in the city’s Elmwood neighborhood in 1916 with the explicit intention of preventing a Black-owned dance hall from entering the neighborhood. Given this history of racist geographies, the Lorin District was one of the few areas in Berkeley where Black and Asian residents could live. Prior to the start of the second world war, the neighborhood had a large population of Black and Japanese residents, but the US policy of Japanese internment further shifted the area’s demographics, as many former Japanese residents lost their homes and businesses.',

I attended school here, received my education here. And I married, produced a family. I am a retired head start teacher, and I have been doing community work early on, because when I arrived here in ‘49, this was the only place that people of my hue and color could find a place to live . . . But this place was populated with people of color, right where we’re sitting in this block, was populated with doctors, lawyers, realtors, and a whole array of business people of color.”',

And when they shared their concerns of trying to purchase a home that they had found across this invisible red and black line, they shared that they could not get together with a creditor or bank that would loan them the money. So the employer stepped in, made the deal, and they made the payment to that person and when it was paid off, they placed it in their name. That is how some people of color made it across the line into the better communities and neighborhoods. Those were some of the experiences that I had and recall.”',

                description: 'In addition to the ongoing histories of redlining, disinvestment, and other racist policies discussed by Tony and Miss Richie, the Lorin District has long been a center of community resiliency, solidarity, and activism. As Miss Richie stated, some Black residents of Lorin held property for their Japanese neighbors during internment, safeguarding these homes until their neighbors were able to return. More recently, a group of South Berkeley neighbors came together to form Friends of Adeline, an organization that, from their own words, works “to affect change so that our neighborhood is an inclusive and just place for all people.” <br> <br> Some of Friends of Adeline’s goals include working to exert local self-determination over the future of the neighborhood, advocating for the construction of affordable housing in the neighborhood, demanding infrastructural improvements and investments geared towards all members of the community, resisting gentrification, and fighting for the ‘right to return’ for people of color pushed out of the neighborhood by uneven development and racist policies. “The Friends of Adeline, it is a mixed group. Age-wise, professional-wise, race-wise. And the concern of a harmonious healthy community,” says Miss Richie, a leading member of the organization. “We speak for and support individuals, human beings, that are having difficulty in surviving in this community. And speak up, and meet with people that are having difficulty when we find it out.”',

                description: 'The Friends of Adeline pinpoints its beginnings to an announcement from the city in 2015. “The city put out a call, an announcement that they were going to do this project to address housing, that this transit hub here was a prime place to do housing and solve the housing issue and revitalize the neighborhood,” recalls Tony. “So Margy and I went to the meeting; it was right down the block at the Senior Center and we knew a few people, but most people we did not know, and it seemed like some people were there with their laptops interested in real estate and then there were some people just from the community.” <br> <br> It was an alarming evaluation of the place he and Margy called home. “It was a pretty well attended conversation. But when the city economic development people were describing the project, the way they talked about the existing community,” says Tony. “It was more about ‘all the exciting things we are gonna do!’ and not what we are drawing from, not ‘what is the history of this community’ and ‘what are its needs’ and ‘what are its aspirations’ but as an opportunity for new people to come in and new buildings. So that was disturbing. When they came to describe what was existing there, there was nothing very positive to talk about for them. They did not see anything of much value.”',
                description2: 'During the meeting, Tony remembers one woman who got up and said something to the effect of, “Gentrification’s been happening and a lot of families have been pushed out. How’s this project going to address the needs of Black families to remain in South Berkeley, to have a place in South Berkeley or to come back?” The mayor said something about how his hands were tied, how he couldn’t control rents or prices of housing or land. Then, by several accounts of those present at that fateful meeting, he said, “We would love for you to stay. But if you can’t, maybe you’d be happier somewhere else.” <br> <br> That was the beginning and end of the response to the question of pushout ––the callousness sent shockwaves. But then Councilmember Max Anderson suggested that the frustrated community members take action independently to develop a vision of their needs, which they could then present to the city. Max even suggested they come up with a name for their group, something like, ‘Friends of Adeline.’',

                description: 'By the time the meeting concluded, attendees from the neighborhood knew that they needed an organization. They weren’t ready to leave the Senior Center, and were upset about what they had just heard. They began to have small gatherings, then several bigger meetings at the South Berkeley Community Church, at which over 100 people came and had conversations in small groups about housing, about cultural issues, about the right to return, about repairing the city’s neglect. The group began to envision a mission statement for their community. Then, the city came forward with a new budget. The Friends of Adeline got a hold of it and did an analysis –– they found that two thirds of the cuts to the old budget were directly solely at the nonprofits that serve their South Berkeley community.',
                description2: '"Friends of Adeline, when we saw what they were doing to the budget, it really revealed that the intention of the city was not honorable, was exploitative, and was the opposite of renewal, it is removal, it is part of a pushing people out,” says Tony. The group insisted that the discussion of the city’s budget should not be in a small room, but accessible to the public that it affected. They made a flier with pictures of young people from Youth Spirit Artworks sitting in front of the Malcolm X mosaic they had completed, and a question on top: ‘Is Berkeley’s Budget Racist?’ The flier talked about the cuts, those affected by the cuts, and invited people to come and speak up for their community at the Longfellow middle school auditorium. Young people, organizers, business owners, people all around the neighborhood packed into the auditorium, and all eyes were looking down on the mayor and the council. At one point, a woman chastised the mayor for looking at his phone when the young people were speaking, and the crowd applauded. The people were alert, listening, watching.',

The resistance against the Adeline Corridor Plan continues today. Friends of Adeline is calling for the City of Berkeley to revise its Adeline plan by ensuring a guaranteed future for the Ashby flea market at the Ashby BART site, funding and a site for the African American Holistic Resource Center, and 100% affordable housing at Ashby BART. <br> <br> Despite the harm done to this neighborhood by decades of racist policy and the incursion of gentrification, a strong spirit of mutual aid lives on here. Although longtime residents of Lorin are contending with considerable threats, their response has not been to resort to paranoia or NIMBY-ism. Far from it: many Lorin residents and community groups welcomed FTCFTH and supported the development of the Here There camp. The fact that a community long denied resources and targeted with predatory ‘revitalization’ policies would extend support to a group of unhoused activists speaks to the incredible resiliency and generosity of Lorin and those who call it home. <br><br><a href="#directory">Back to Table of Contents</a>',

As with all prior FTCFTH camps, Here There practiced consensus-based self governance and enforced several simple, yet firm rules including: sobriety (excluding marijuana, for medicinal purposes), cleanliness, no violence or fighting, noise curfews, attendance of weekly meetings, and more. The camp’s rules were designed to be flexible enough so as to not be coercive, yet strictly enforced enough to maintain a safe and organized atmosphere. <br> <br> “You just had to read them and agree to them, basically. Oh yeah, the breaking of a rule would gather you a strike, and if you got three strikes, you’d be out,” says Julio, a current resident of Here There. “And sometimes we’d have to kick people out. And sometimes they’d leave quickly, other times we would just have to go through some shit just to get them out.”',

And I could leave during the day and not even lock my tent or nothing, and everything would still be there when I got back. And that was a good feeling. I liked that, and we set up a cantina area in a big garage / car cover, awning. And we set it up with propane, we set it up with water.

The camp doesn’t discriminate or have prejudices against different ethnicities, or ages,” says Toan Nguyen, a former member and active advocate for the unhoused. “It’s not just sober. I want to extend the ‘stable’ part of it, and the function.” Many people who come to the camp have already seen the city’s official services –– the first-come-first-serve shelters and resources that enforce curfews and leave the latecomers in the cold. “It’s more of a controlling atmosphere, with the city-run programs,” he explains. “But the camp provides a stable place for people to get back on their feet, just to make it more clear.”',
                description2: '“People are unhoused for different reasons,” says Toan. “We don’t ask them why they’re unhoused, they can share if they want to. But it can be personal, I mean people don’t want to share <i> Oh, because I have a disability, or I have mental health… or I got evicted. </i> Some things can be triggering or emotional or personal, so they don’t want to share that… but since it’s a community, like a tight-knit community, eventually people share in conversation. People share and we get to know each other, and we get to know how they are and how we can help one another.” <br> <br> Then, there’s the sobriety element –– a strict rule that has become synonymous with the Here There camp. “So it’s clean, sober, but marijuana is tolerated. People there use marijuana for medicinal purposes, and I don’t consider marijuana a bad drug, so it’s fine, as long as they don’t abuse it, of course,” says Toan. “But the reason why the camp is strict on alcohol and hard substances is because, as you know, it affects people’s behavior. Whether they’re trying to do right, or whether their intentions are good or not, alcohol will really influence their behavior. To be in a sober environment, I think it helps everyone.”',

The camp had a probationary period before those attempting to join were given full membership, which was intended to screen out any inappropriate behavior by a consensus vote. <br> <br> Toan provided more details on the entry process for new members. “So at the Here There camp… it’s not without its bureaucracy of course, so in order to come in, people have to… unless it’s urgent or an emergency basis, and someone from the camp can vouch for them, they’re required to go through a process of coming in, which is attend the meeting, introduce themself and answer questions,” says Toan. “And if everyone is willing to give them a chance, or if there’s no objections, they’re able to come in, live inside, and then people will make sure they have a tent, beddings, and a space, everything they need. And they get put on probation period, which is four weeks now. At the time that I was there, I think it was just two weeks. But Leslie extended it. During the probation period we ask them to attend a meeting, just to follow up to see how they’re doing, any help they need, or if there’s any issues with them. And after the probation period, they get membership status, which is good, in a way, so they know that they can stay there longer.”',

Residents of Here There took on the responsibility of trash disposal, which was a lengthy and difficult process during the earlier periods of the camp. <br> <br> “I realized that the best way to keep anyone from yelling at you was to do something useful for the group,” said Sam, “I started taking out the garbage every day because we had no garbage service at the time: what I did was I used the cans that are at the bus stops.”',

Have them at this place, at this time, boom.’ Trash did not accumulate, which means there are no rats.” In addition to trash disposal, controlling rats was a vital element of daily camp maintenance.

That’s an opportunity for communities to build, or for building community. And it reached out to people that would otherwise not pay attention to homeless matters, or things like that. And I think it also helps the unhoused be looked at in a different way: “Okay, these are the unhoused, and they’re organizing something.”” <br> <br> In the end, Judge Alsup did not grant the camp a preliminary injunction, allowing BART to proceed with the eviction. However, Judge Alsup moved forward with a case concerning whether the City of Berkeley had violated the civil rights of First They Came for the Homeless during previous evictions. Despite the absence of any injunctive relief, the federal judge did call for BART to provide the camp with an explanation of when exactly the eviction would occur, so campers could take steps to prepare. Explaining his logic, Judge Alsup said “Judges are sworn to uphold the law . . . I wish sometimes the law was more generous to the poor than it already is.” Regardless of this outcome, many FTCFTH members saw the initial TRO as a historic victory for the camp, and illustrative of unhoused activism achieving success through official pathways.',

In January of 2018, a few months after the original camp vacated the area around the sculpture, BART installed a tall black fence topped with sharp spikes. BART’s official rationale for installing the fence was to protect the right of way of the train, and to prevent anyone from entering the area around the tracks, and the City of Berkeley signed off on the fence design. This fence was the second to encircle an area formerly occupied by FTCFTH: the first was the metal fence installed by USPS at the Berkeley Main Post Office. Many viewed this fence as symbolically and practically dangerous. <br> <br> The fence was also costly: the SF Chronicle reported in February of 2018 that the total cost was $120,000. Housed residents of Lorin were similarly unhappy with the fence. “BART fenced it [the camp] off with a fence that would not be in North Berkeley or in the hills,” says Miss Richie. “They would not put that unsightly fence there.”',

The fence communicated that this land’s only acceptable use was to buffer the tracks, delineating distance between BART and the surrounding community. This message contradicted the “HERETHERE” sculpture, a piece of public art paid for by the City of Berkeley, and presumably intended to welcome the public. As many  <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/BART-s-big-fences-keep-homeless-out-but-12604779.php" target="_blank" style="color: blue">articles</a> and public statements observed, the fence surrounding the installation significantly obscures the letters. <br> <br> In fact, the artist responsible for the installation has publicly criticized the fence in multiple interviews. Steve Gillman called the fence “a very Trumpian move by BART.” Talking to  <a href="https://thestreetspirit.org/2019/02/01/in-dialogue-with-steve-gillman-the-creator-of-south-berkeleys-herethere-sculpture/" target="_blank" style="color: blue">Street Spirit</a>, Gillman said of the fence “It separates the work rather than allowing it to be a part of the rest of the world. And so it has completely changed. The piece is no longer what it was intended to be, it is no longer what Berkeley bought.” There is no doubt in campers’ minds that the fence exists as a condemnation of the Here There camp, physically marking the space that the camp once was and can never be again, at least without harsh resistance from BART. <br> <br> Steve Gillman and others spoke up to express their frustration with the fence at a City Council Meeting on January 23, 2018. At the time, Ben Bartlett, a Berkeley Councilmember, stated that “affirmative measures” were being taken to remove the “prison-style fence.” Councilmembers Ben Bartlett and Cheryl Davila co-sponsored an agenda item to remove the fence, which Bartlett went on to call “ugly,” “depressing,” and “unnecessary.” A group of neighbors started a petition to remove the fence and replace it with a playground on the site.

Farha came to the camp in January 2018 and spoke with Mike Zint and FTCFTH lawyer EmilyRose Johns about the organization’s purpose and its experiences of eviction. During the same trip, Farha visited camps in Oakland and San Francisco.

This recommendation was agenda item ‘38a’ at a Berkeley City Council meeting on February 13, 2018. This particular agenda item reportedly sparked a long and spirited debate, but ultimately did not move forward -- a tale as old as time.',

Sam helped create solar panel systems at each of the three new Here There camps following the BART eviction notice. Implementing solar systems allowed camps to be more self-sufficient, as residents could charge necessary electronic devices without leaving camp to go to coffee shops or libraries. At its height, the solar arrays at the three camps had a combined total output of 2,080 watts, and provided power to around forty people. <br> <br> Residents of the evicted Old City Hall camp were forced to move along yet again. Some joined the Aquatic Park camp, while others returned to the smaller camp that had stayed at the Here There site. For months, Aquatic Park effectively functioned like any other FTCFTH camp, abiding by the fundamental rules of sobriety and consensus. The Aquatic Park site began to grow beyond the initial group of FTCFTH members, experiencing an influx of population. Over time, the population of the camp nearly doubled from the original 10 or 15 members to 25 people. By some accounts, individuals outside the original group began selling drugs and allowing conditions to deteriorate. The core group of FTCFTH members tried to maintain order and consensus governance, but over time, the group’s ability to enforce rules eroded. Troublesome outsiders kicked out by FTCFTH would routinely return to the camp, disregarding consensus decisions. Conditions continued to worsen, and FTCFTH could not maintain the governance process as outsiders began to dump trash near the camp — attracting rats, creating public health concerns, and drawing the attention of the City of Berkeley. Soon, the camp was evicted. But this time, a new set of rules applied: unlike prior FTCFTH evictions, this camp was evicted following a Ninth Circuit Court ruling known as <i>Martin v. Boise</i>, which had considerable impacts on homeless policy in affected states. So now, a brief (but necessary) explanation of <i>Martin v. Boise</i>: its context, its impacts, and its legacy.',

The measure would ban sitting on sidewalks in business districts from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., and was supported heavily by John Caner, CEO of the Downtown Berkeley Association, who hoped the ordinance would “shoo homeless people away from the main commercial districts.” Despite receiving more than $105,080 in donations that year —more than any other campaign in Berkeley — and outraising the measure’s opponents 7 to 1, Measure S failed. This was just two years after San Francisco’s own Civil Sidewalks Ordinance had passed, the very one that First They Came for the Homeless had protested during Occupy. <br> <br> Anti-homeless legislation was on the rise in cities across the United States, often backed by Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) such as the Downtown Berkeley Association.

Then there are lawyers like Osha Neumann and Andrea Henson, journalists from Berkeleyside and Street Spirit, members of the People’s Park Committee, Where Do We Go, Consider the Homeless!, Suitcase Clinic, the Berkeley Outreach Coalition, and many, many people who were formerly unhoused.

In 2018, <i>Martin v. Boise</i> was brought to the Ninth Circuit of Appeals by six homeless individuals against the city of Boise, Idaho. The ruling held that cities cannot enforce anti-camping ordinances if they did not provide an adequate alternative (i.e., enough shelter beds), and that doing so would violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition on Cruel and Unusual Punishment. The case set precedent for nine Western states under the Ninth Circuit: Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. <br> <br> <i>Boise</i> is often cited when police and city officials attempt eviction, because there is rarely an appropriate alternative shelter available in the City of Berkeley. Reportedly, residents at the city’s newest Grayson Shelter cannot take showers in the building, because the water system in the old warehouse is simply not strong enough for it. The cohabitation model, with no private space, can be traumatizing for many. And for others, the opposite problem –– total fracture from trusted connections within their encampment community. Calling upon <i>Boise</i> is a way to communicate the inherent injustice in the lack of better alternatives for those criminalized for simply not having access to better shelter.',

The first of which is <i>Robinson v. California</i>, a landmark decision by the United States Supreme Court in 1962. In <i>Robinson</i>, a jury had found the defendant guilty under a California statute that criminalized addiction to narcotics. The Court ruled 6-2 that imprisoning those who suffered from the “illness” of addiction was cruel and unusual punishment, likening the affliction of addiction to mental illness and even venereal disease. The significance in the <i>Robinson</i> doctrine was its emphasis on the unconstitutional criminalization of ‘status.’ States could still punish conduct, as long as they did not punish status. For example, purchase, sale, or possession of illegal narcotics could still be illegal, but not the status of merely being addicted to them.',

Justice White (who had dissented in <i>Robinson</i>), cast the fifth and deciding vote against Powell’s appeal, but noted that his vote was limited to this particular case. As White pointed out, the innocent behavior of being an alcoholic, or drunk in one’s own private space, was transformed as culpable conduct when Powell chose not to stay at home. But if walking around drunk in public is punishable conduct and staying at home is not, what happens when there’s no home to protect one’s drunkenness as status?',

In accordance with <i>Boise</i>, Berkeley provided the Aquatic Park camp with 27 vouchers for shelter beds at the Dorothy Day House Shelter in the Veteran’s Building. Mike Zint speculated that the City of Berkeley was consciously maintaining shelter vacancies for the purpose of justifying evictions. If the city held onto a number of shelter vacancies comparable to the size of one camp, it could legally evict a camp at any time. Only one of the 27 vouchers was accepted. <br> <br> Often, when camps are evicted and residents are offered shelter vouchers, they are forced to accept strict rules and abandon necessary possessions that cannot be taken in. Even more restrictive are the shelter occupation limits, which often range from one to 30 nights. Though shelters can provide a reprieve from the elements, residents are often unable to secure permanent housing during their stays, and end up returning to the street without the vital possessions they discarded to abide by shelter restrictions. As with any eviction, the closing of the Aquatic Park camp caused chaos and panic for residents, and left many without solid options for shelter. A few residents returned to the Here There camp, which was now located closer to the sidewalk on Adeline Street, outside the fence. <br><br><a href="#directory">Back to Table of Contents</a>',

                description: 'In 2019, the last of the cases heard by Judge Alsup concerning FTCFTH came to a close. In May, a federal jury trial was held to determine whether the City of Berkeley had violated the 1st, 4th, and / or 14th amendment rights of FTCFTH. Adam Brendenberg, Benjamin Royer, and Clark Sullivan were plaintiffs, and sought damages for the city’s seizure and loss of their personal belongings during police raids. FTCFTH alleged that the City of Berkeley had unfairly targeted the group because of its explicitly political nature. The plaintiffs and others who testified during the trial described how police raids separated them from necessary possessions, including medical equipment. The City insisted that it had given ample notice prior to evictions, provided storage for valuable items, and removed camps using minimal force. The City, however, was unable to produce copies of the notices it had posted, and claimed the documents had been ‘wiped’ after the employee handling these records retired. On May 24, 2019, <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2019/05/24/jury-finds-berkeley-did-not-violate-a-homeless-groups-civil-rights" target="_blank" style="color: blue">the trial came to a close</a>, and the jury decided that FTCFTH had not been unduly targeted by the city, or had belongings confiscated or eliminated without notice.

As Hyphae began surveying citizens and cataloging the state of current public facilities, it became apparent that the degree of inaccessibility was severe. The city had only four 24/7 bathrooms that weren’t porta-potties. Most commercial zones had no bathrooms within a quarter mile. The city’s busiest BART stations are insufficiently supported by very few stalls. Upon site visits to existing bathrooms, the surveyors rated most facilities ‘poor.’ Hyphae included recommendations from stakeholders across the board, including Here There Camp, Friends of Adeline, Suitcase Clinic, Drop-in Center, Consider the Homeless!, Berkeley Friends on Wheels, among many others. The report concluded that existing public bathrooms in Berkeley do not meet public need, due to a lack of accessibility, open hours, cleanliness, visibility, and security. <br> <br> Throughout the Poor Tour, the camp had repeatedly requested a porta-potty from the city. By 2017, when they arrived at the still unfenced Here There sculpture, the urgent need for a porta potty became one of the camp’s top priorities. After months without real action from the city, the camp organized a ‘Party for a Potty’ Fundraiser, and raised part of the funds needed for a porta-potty.',

The bathroom was routinely vandalized and disrespected, and was at times used as a place for private drug use by people outside the camp (which threatened the camp’s own status as a sober space). On one occasion, as Stacey describes, someone even tipped the bathroom into the street, creating chaos and a horrible mess. Making sure the bathroom was safe and available to those who needed it became a full-time pursuit for Stacey. In the end, a variety of creative approaches helped solve the disruptions. Stacey chained the bathroom to the fence to protect it from being tipped over, and he also added a lock to the bathroom to ensure that it would not be vandalized or used for illicit purposes. The camp maintained several copies of the key, which they provided to anyone who asked: Stacey was very explicit that the purpose of this lock was not to monopolize access for the camp, but to ensure that the bathroom would remain in a condition suitable for use.',

To Stacey, imposing a barrier to access, even a necessary one, went against elements of his own political philosophy. As one might imagine, the city also took issue with the lock. On several occasions, the city sent police officers or other city workers to cut the lock. Every time, Stacey would simply reinstall the lock. Eventually, the story goes, the city had had enough, and decided on a de facto truce.

When rain’s coming, you have to prepare for it, make sure you have empty bottles you can relieve in, or do hygiene, wash up, empty out your trash, things like that. So now, I just get up, and the bathroom’s just right there. It feels kind of nice: at the same time, there are times when I feel like “do I even deserve this?” This is my thought: I think this is one of the reasons why organizers put in a lot of work, because they want to feel that the privilege that they have, especially unhoused advocates that are inside, it’s worth it, like they deserve it, because of the work they’re putting in. I think I kind of got the sense of that, a bit.”',

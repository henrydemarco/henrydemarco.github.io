To James, Mike Zint was a “true hero,” a captain of Occupy who honed his skills as a political strategist and activist in one of the most zealous occupations in the country. James remembers Occupy SF as a concerted battle against the Federal Reserve and the manifold abuses of the American financial system. Through Occupy, participants created an organic, living alternative to the totalizing capitalist systems that defined American life. For the duration of these occupations, activists carved out spaces for protest and experimental living in the administrative centers of capitalist repression, places like Wall Street and San Francisco’s Financial District. Occupiers’ profound experiences inspired outgrowths into other movements and experiments.',

There was also Occupy Berkeley, which was much smaller, about 100 tents in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park constituted its main encampment. Occupy Cal was UC Berkeley’s own campus-driven movement, more concerned about the labor inequalities affecting the education system. Even San Jose had its own Occupy. Occupy Oakland converged with First They Came for the Homeless in dramatic fashion in the years following the (approximate) end of the Occupy movement, when multiple groups came together to protest the proposed sale of the historic Berkeley Main Post Office. <br> <br> “What I remember is that there were people in tents that were occupying the Post Office building: it was an attempt to keep the powers that be from selling that historic building and closing down the Post Office,” says Tony Wilkinson, local activist, community organizer, and member of Friends of Adeline. “There was a community group that was trying to hold on to it. But First They Came For The Homeless, which came out of Occupy — they had a social view of what people are up against, the need for collective action, a way to begin to challenge systemically or aggressively the right to define where you are gonna go and how you’re gonna live, and help to stabilize people.”',

USPS intended to shift core responsibilities to the existing Berkeley Destination Delivery Unit, and pursue a new location in downtown Berkeley for retail operations. Around the same time, USPS had listed dozens of historic post offices for sale, citing operating deficits. Despite the concerted efforts of local groups across the country, several historic post offices had already been sold. The prospects of protecting Berkeley’s Main Post Office looked grim, especially given the fact that the planned sale was being categorized as “relocation” as opposed to “closure,” which further limited legal possibilities for halting the process. When the Berkeley public learned of the Postal Service’s intentions, an organization called Save the Berkeley Post Office quickly formed to resist the planned sale. In February of 2013, when USPS representatives met with the Berkeley public regarding the planned sale, they encountered an outpouring of public resistance, including a large rally. The Berkeley City Council also passed a resolution in March of 2013 calling on USPS to postpone the sale for a year. A year later, USPS announced that they were moving forward with the sale. <br> <br> By May, several of the groups involved in efforts to protect the Post Office, and resist privatization more broadly, came together to form a coalition called the Berkeley Post Office Defenders (BPOD “pronounced bee-pod”). The group’s members included members of Strike Debt Bay Area, Occupy Oakland, and Save the Berkeley Post Office. The coalition announced their <a href="https://strike-debt-bay-area.tumblr.com/post/56520032739/block-privatization-of-the-post-office" target="_blank" style="color: red">Direct Defense of the Berkeley Post Office</a> on July 26, 2013. Protesters from the coalition set up information tables and tents at the Post Office, inviting the public to engage in dialogue. For those involved in the resistance, what was at stake extended far beyond one post office: this was about combating austerity, about refusing to sit idly while public resources were shorn away in the name of ‘cutting operational costs.’ Many worried that these sorts of sell-offs would constitute the start of the privatization of the US Postal Service. BPOD’s timeline was explicit from the start: the protest would end when the sale was reversed, and no earlier.',

Soon, others joined in. His group was an early incarnation of First They Came for the Homeless, and its first organized action since its inception in 2011. The Downtown Berkeley Staples was part of a pilot program to offload USPS duties to Staples, another corner cut in the sweeping austerity of the Obama administration. If successful, the program could enable USPS to cut costs by passing off key responsibilities to Staples workers, whose undervalued labor was more cost-effective than that of unionized postal workers. The Staples occupation existed as a 24/7 protest against the pilot program, as well as a way to further inform the public of the plan to sell the post office on Allston Way. <br> <br> During Mike Zint’s time outside the Shattuck Avenue Staples, he met like-minded organizers involved in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIaj8kK9Wyw" target="_blank" style="color: red">ongoing post office defense</a>. BPOD’s mission aligned with that of FTCFTH, so collaboration between the two groups came naturally. Zint’s camp moved to the Main Post Office at Allston Way to contribute to the defense through an occupation — Mike’s specialty. The sale was still set to proceed in 2014, so that November, BPOD and FTCFTH began an active, prolonged camp in the spirit of Occupy, drawing in homeless activists and calling on former Occupiers. And, as with previous occupations, their residency was a prime opportunity to highlight the criminalization of homelessness more broadly. Tents provided not only shelter — they were also a technique of public assembly.',

Then, in 2016, USPS brought suit against the City of Berkeley, claiming that those 2014 zoning changes were unconstitutional. All the while, BPOD and FTCFTH continued their occupation. The encampment persisted in front of the Berkeley Main Post Office for 17 months.

Two years later, the trial over Berkeley’s zoning changes began. By May of 2018, the saga concluded, as U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup ruled that Berkeley had not acted unconstitutionally in its creation of the Civic Center Overlay. Though USPS could technically still legally sell the building, the site remains a post office today, and the overlay is still in effect. Judge Alsup’s decision was never appealed.',

People had been holding vigil outside Old City Hall since 6 a.m. on Monday, fasting and “sleeping out” in solidarity with the homeless. The camp was a new venture of FTCFTH, occurring concurrently with the ongoing Post Office Occupation. They called themselves Liberty City. 30 people had marched from Liberty City to Longfellow Middle School, where they joined the queue of people waiting their turn at the mic. That night, Vice Mayor Linda Maio was bringing forth Item 28, a proposal to “Improve Conditions on our Community Sidewalks.” If instituted, the ordinances would prohibit people from having more than two square feet of personal possessions on sidewalks from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Not two-by-two square feet, but <i> two square feet </i>. Item 28 would also outlaw laying down inside planter beds or on planter walls. Those with shopping carts would be forced to move belongings to a new block every hour, and those who failed to comply with these restrictions could face a steep fine. <br> <br> One notable inclusion in the proposal was an ordinance prohibiting public urination and defecation, crimes that were already well established in county and statewide code. These additions were entirely redundant — the statewide code against public urination was enacted in 1872. Some homeless advocates speculated that their inclusion was meant to bolster popular support for the proposal and discredit detractors. By including these restrictions in the proposal, supporters could make homeless advocates working to block the action appear to be acting in favor of allowing public defecation and urination. By manipulating optics in this manner, supporters of the proposal could shift the conversation away from the material concerns of unhoused people (such as the <a href="https://berkeley.maps.arcgis.com/apps/View/index.html?appid=715bb83772db4b85b64c44fc5dbce21f&extent=-122.3410,37.8350,-122.2143,37.8973" target="_blank" style="color: red">severe lack of public bathrooms</a> in Berkeley) and towards more general, popular appeals to public ‘cleanliness.’ The new ordinances would be enforced upon the installation of an alternative storage option: 50 lockers, for Berkeley’s unhoused population of nearly 1,000. The total estimated cost of implementing the ordinances came up to $300,000 per year. After four hours of fervent testimony from the public, the council held a preliminary vote at 12:30 am. They voted to pass, 6-3.',

The auditorium of Longfellow Middle School was crowded, and as the night wore on, the energy became volatile. Maio grew increasingly impatient with the dissenting citizens. A vote to extend the meeting to 11:30 p.m. did not pass, and Councilman Kriss Worthington had the floor. Maio interrupted, accusing him of running down the clock to avoid a vote. This brought the crowd to a fever pitch. <br> <br> A member of the crowd <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkZxqth8zeM&feature=emb_title" target="_blank" style="color: red">took to the mic</a>. “It is a violation of the California Brown Act, to deny people the right to speak,” JP Massar said, citing the legislation that ensures citizens their right to participate in local governments. Maio continued to speak over him, calling for a vote. Massar then repeated his mantra. “You have the right to clear the room, but you do not have the right to deny people the right to speak,” he said, his voice bellowing over the soundsystem. The council passed the ordinance. Berkeley police evicted the residents of Liberty City three days later. <br> <br> Maio’s ordinance was adopted, but the policy was never enforced because the lockers were never made available. Providing lockers was the responsibility of the City Manager – to some, this fallthrough suggests that perhaps the City Council passed this ordinance only under pressure and in the heat of the moment. Another possibility is that the ordinance was simply too broad to allow for effective enforcement: constantly policing the exact geometric bounds of every unhoused person’s possessions in Berkeley is a massive, costly, and ultimately impossible project.',

In 1820, Luís María Peralta, a sergeant of the Spanish Army and an administrator of Native American removal, received a land grant of 44,800 acres from California’s last Spanish Governor, Pablo Vicente de Solá. The Peralta Grant —one of the largest Spanish land grants— was a gift in recognition of the soldier’s years of long service guarding missions, fighting Native Americans, and keeping ledgers of cattle. The grant stretched from the El Cerrito Creek to the San Leandro Creek, which encompasses six and a half cities today, including Berkeley. From 1769 to 1821, California was a Spanish colony, and Peralta’s land grant was one of around twenty land grants made to individuals. <br> <br> California then became an independent nation of Mexico from 1821 to 1846. During this time, Mexico issued some six to eight hundred grants. The legal claims to land held by rancheros like the Peraltas were tenuous, by the time California was transferred to the United States in 1848. The same year, gold was discovered in the Sierras. New neighbors, squatters, cattle rustlers, and developers were hungry to settle, and new laws made it easier to lay claim to the Peraltas’ land. Newcomers flooded through Oakland on the newly completed Transcontinental Railroad. The family fought squatters all the way to the Supreme Court, but legal fees forced the Peraltas to sell more land; by 1877, they had lost almost all of the original 44,800 acres. ',

A visit to the Berkeley Historical Society revealed that the first known use of “Lorin” as a designation for this area was on an application to the federal government in 1882 proposing a post office in the area that would be called “Lorin.” There’s also a rough verification of the geographic position of the Lorin Post Office, with details such as “3 miles from said nearest creek [never named], on the east side of it.” This document dates back to 1888, and confirms that the name “Lorin” was accepted by the United States Post Office Department (the predecessor to USPS). The original application, attached below, curiously features the name “Garfield" crossed out and replaced with “Lorin.” Who replaced the original “Garfield” remains a mystery with much speculation.',

The Great Migration is one of the largest movements of any group in American history, and can be understood in two waves. The First Great Migration (1910-1940) was a relocation to the north and midwest; as industrial jobs were left vacant during the first world war, Black populations joined the non-agricultural labor supply. Although migrants moved to escape from racial hostility, they were met by similar prejudices and tensions in their new communities, from white people who were furious with the changing demographics. The Second Great Migration (1940-1970), people moved further north, but also west. Black people who migrated after World War II were met with organized pushback from the white localities, who had begun to implement discriminatory and segregationist practices.',

Grove Street had been understood in this city as an unofficial line of segregation, but New Deal era loaning practices had made such a line <i>official</i>. Under Roosevelt, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) was created to provide affordable mortgages in the wake of the Depression. HOLC needed to assure banks, however, that borrowers would not default. The organization drew up lending security maps of major American cities, supposedly for banks to assess lending risks. In reality, the maps produced were informed by the demographics of different neighborhoods, with the various ‘grades’ being encoded with an area’s racial makeup. The maps separated cities into four grades: A as “best,” B as “desirable,” C as “declining,” and D as “hazardous.” The best areas were green, the most hazardous areas were red. <br> <br> In Berkeley, MLK Jr. Way was the line that divided the red from the rest. Redlining inscribed racist notions in space, classifying non-white neighborhoods as ‘hazardous’ and effectively legalizing discriminatory lending practices. Redlining was only one of many legal and financial implements that contributed to segregation in US cities and produced geographies of difference in which non-white residents were exploited, denied services, and shut out of opportunities for wealth creation. This is the necessary context for understanding Lorin, a vibrant, historically non-white community that lay south of the literal red line that was once Grove Street.',

Many newly settled Black Berkeleyans worked in shipyards in Richmond as part of the burgeoning wartime defense industry. White property owners in Berkeley worked tirelessly to exclude the city’s non-white residents from housing opportunities, petitioning the city council to implement racial zoning laws. The Berkeley Realty Board was a favorite instrument of financial discrimination: the board supported the creation of neighborhood covenants that excluded would-be non-white home buyers, particularly Black and Asian people. Also worth noting is that Berkeley was the birthplace of single-family zoning, a practice that began in the city’s Elmwood neighborhood in 1916 with the explicit intention of preventing a Black-owned dance hall from entering the neighborhood. Given this history of racist geographies, the Lorin District was one of the few areas in Berkeley where Black and Asian residents could live. Prior to the start of the second world war, the neighborhood had a large population of Black and Japanese residents, but the US policy of Japanese internment further shifted the area’s demographics, as many former Japanese residents lost their homes and businesses.',

I attended school here, received my education here. And I married, produced a family. I am a retired head start teacher, and I have been doing community work early on, because when I arrived here in ‘49, this was the only place that people of my hue and color could find a place to live . . . But this place was populated with people of color, right where we’re sitting in this block, was populated with doctors, lawyers, realtors, and a whole array of business people of color.”',
                description2: '“This busiest intersection up here at Adeline, which was Grove, was an invisible red and black line, so that people of color could only live in this area,” says Miss Richie, gesturing towards the divergence of MLK Jr. Way and Shattuck. “And the way that some made it across this invisible line was that they were a nanny, a housekeeper, a gardener of some Caucasian person. And when they shared their concerns of trying to purchase a home that they had found across this invisible red and black line, they shared that they could not get together with a creditor or bank that would loan them the money. So the employer stepped in, made the deal, and they made the payment to that person and when it was paid off, they placed it in their name. That is how some people of color made it across the line into the better communities and neighborhoods. Those were some of the experiences that I had and recall.”',

But when the city economic development people were describing the project, the way they talked about the existing community,” says Tony. “It was more about ‘all the exciting things we are gonna do!’ and not what we are drawing from, not ‘what is the history of this community’ and ‘what are its needs’ and ‘what are its aspirations’ but as an opportunity for new people to come in and new buildings. So that was disturbing. When they came to describe what was existing there, there was nothing very positive to talk about for them. They did not see anything of much value.”',

How’s this project going to address the needs of Black families to remain in South Berkeley, to have a place in South Berkeley or to come back?” The mayor said something about how his hands were tied, how he couldn’t control rents or prices of housing or land. Then, by several accounts of those present at that fateful meeting, he said, “We would love for you to stay. But if you can’t, maybe you’d be happier somewhere else.” <br> <br> That was the beginning and end of the response to the question of pushout ––the callousness sent shockwaves. But then Councilmember Max Anderson suggested that the frustrated community members take action independently to develop a vision of their needs, which they could then present to the city. Max even suggested they come up with a name for their group, something like, ‘Friends of Adeline.’',

They weren’t ready to leave the Senior Center, and were upset about what they had just heard. They began to have small gatherings, then several bigger meetings at the South Berkeley Community Church, at which over 100 people came and had conversations in small groups about housing, about cultural issues, about the right to return, about repairing the city’s neglect. The group began to envision a mission statement for their community. Then, the city came forward with a new budget. The Friends of Adeline got a hold of it and did an analysis –– they found that two thirds of the cuts to the old budget were directly solely at the nonprofits that serve their South Berkeley community.',

The group insisted that the discussion of the city’s budget should not be in a small room, but accessible to the public that it affected. They made a flier with pictures of young people from Youth Spirit Artworks sitting in front of the Malcolm X mosaic they had completed, and a question on top: ‘Is Berkeley’s Budget Racist?’ The flier talked about the cuts, those affected by the cuts, and invited people to come and speak up for their community at the Longfellow middle school auditorium. Young people, organizers, business owners, people all around the neighborhood packed into the auditorium, and all eyes were looking down on the mayor and the council. At one point, a woman chastised the mayor for looking at his phone when the young people were speaking, and the crowd applauded. The people were alert, listening, watching.',

Although longtime residents of Lorin are contending with considerable threats, their response has not been to resort to paranoia or NIMBY-ism. Far from it: many Lorin residents and community groups welcomed FTCFTH and supported the development of the Here / There camp.

By the time people got out there, that was it. The only way they got out of that was if people from the outside came and got them out.”',

The camp’s rules were designed to be flexible enough so as to not be coercive, yet strictly enforced enough to maintain a safe and organized atmosphere. <br> <br> “You just had to read them and agree to them, basically. Oh yeah, the breaking of a rule would gather you a strike, and if you got three strikes, you’d be out,” says Julio, a current resident of Here / There. “And sometimes we’d have to kick people out. And sometimes they’d leave quickly, other times we would just have to go through some shit just to get them out.”',

I just set myself up with a tent of adequate size, and put my furnishings that I had in it. And I could leave during the day and not even lock my tent or nothing, and everything would still be there when I got back. And that was a good feeling. I liked that, and we set up a cantina area in a big garage / car cover, awning. And we set it up with propane, we set it up with water.

The camp doesn’t discriminate or have prejudices against different ethnicities, or ages,” says Toan Nguyen, a former member and active advocate for the unhoused. “It’s not just sober. I want to extend the ‘stable’ part of it, and the function.” Many people who come to the camp have already seen the city’s official services –– the first-come-first-serve shelters and resources that enforce curfews and leave the latecomers in the cold. “It’s more of a controlling atmosphere, with the city-run programs,” he explains. “But the camp provides a stable place for people to get back on their feet, just to make it more clear.”',
                description2: '“People are unhoused for different reasons,” says Toan. “We don’t ask them why they’re unhoused, they can share if they want to. But it can be personal, I mean people don’t want to share <i> Oh, because I have a disability, or I have mental health… or I got evicted. </i> Some things can be triggering or emotional or personal, so they don’t want to share that… but since it’s a community, like a tight-knit community, eventually people share in conversation. People share and we get to know each other, and we get to know how they are and how we can help one another.” <br> <br> Then, there’s the sobriety element –– a strict rule that has become synonymous with the Here/There camp. “So it’s clean, sober, but marijuana is tolerated. People there use marijuana for medicinal purposes, and I don’t consider marijuana a bad drug, so it’s fine, as long as they don’t abuse it, of course,” says Toan. “But the reason why the camp is strict on alcohol and hard substances is because, as you know, it affects people’s behavior. Whether they’re trying to do right, or whether their intentions are good or not, alcohol will really influence their behavior. To be in a sober environment, I think it helps everyone.”',

The process of entering camp was not immediate, even after attending a weekly meeting. The camp had a probationary period before those attempting to join were given full membership, which was intended to screen out any inappropriate behavior by a consensus vote. <br> <br> Toan provided more details on the entry process for new members. “So at the Here / There camp… it’s not without its bureaucracy of course, so in order to come in, people have to… unless it’s urgent or an emergency basis, and someone from the camp can vouch for them, they’re required to go through a process of coming in, which is attend the meeting, introduce themself and answer questions,” says Toan. “And if everyone is willing to give them a chance, or if there’s no objections, they’re able to come in, live inside, and then people will make sure they have a tent, beddings, and a space, everything they need. And they get put on probation period, which is four weeks now. At the time that I was there, I think it was just two weeks. But Leslie extended it. During the probation period we ask them to attend a meeting, just to follow up to see how they’re doing, any help they need, or if there’s any issues with them. And after the probation period, they get membership status, which is good, in a way, so they know that they can stay there longer.”',

                description2: 'Beyond administrative functions like meetings, managing new entries, and handling funds, camp members worked to make the space functional and pleasant. The camp’s physical infrastructure greatly contributed to the waves of media attention it attracted over the years. Eventually, the camp featured functional solar panels and batteries, a kitchen tent, and a garden. The camp’s organized appearance also helped draw in new members. Alex remembers being impressed with the camp’s structure, which contributed to him joining. “It was probably the cleanest and best camp you could go to, that I had seen,” he says. “The fact that it was fairly well organized, and there were solar panels and things was really great. The political nature of it really made me excited about what we could do, and I was really excited about doing all the city council meetings.” <br> <br> Despite the camp’s political reputation, not everyone was personally interested in making a change within the larger picture. “I think for a lot of people there, it wasn’t totally political. I think a lot of people just kind of wanted housing for themselves,” says Alex. “And I think that’s fine, I don’t think it necessarily had to be political. <b> The existence of people without houses is political itself.</b>”',

The provision or denial of trash collection is one of the most significant powers that cities have over encampments. The accumulation of trash at a camp contributes to complaints from the surrounding community, so a camp’s ability to dispose of its own trash is paramount for its longevity. Residents of Here / There took on the responsibility of trash disposal, which was a lengthy and difficult process during the earlier periods of the camp. <br> <br> “I realized that the best way to keep anyone from yelling at you was to do something useful for the group,” said Sam, “I started taking out the garbage every day because we had no garbage service at the time: what I did was I used the cans that are at the bus stops.”',
                description2: 'Eventually, the City began to provide assistance with trash pickup. “They also developed ways to work with the city in terms of collecting trash,” says Tony. “They got a guy from the city who would say ‘Here are the bags, if you put your trash in these orange bags, I will pick them up. Have them at this place, at this time, boom.’ Trash did not accumulate, which means there are no rats.” In addition to trash disposal, controlling rats was a vital element of daily camp maintenance. The camp went to incredible lengths to ensure that the ever-present rats are kept at bay.',

That’s an opportunity for communities to build, or for building community. And it reached out to people that would otherwise not pay attention to homeless matters, or things like that.

However, Judge Alsup moved forward with a case concerning whether the City of Berkeley had violated the civil rights of First They Came for the Homeless during previous evictions. Despite the absence of any injunctive relief, the federal judge did call for BART to provide the camp with an explanation of when exactly the eviction would occur, so campers could take steps to prepare. Explaining his logic, Judge Alsup said “Judges are sworn to uphold the law . . . I wish sometimes the law was more generous to the poor than it already is.” Regardless of this outcome, many FTCFTH members saw the initial TRO as a historic victory for the camp, and illustrative of unhoused activism achieving success through official pathways.',

In January of 2018, a few months after the original camp vacated the area around the sculpture, BART installed a tall black fence topped with sharp spikes. BART’s official rationale for installing the fence was to protect the right of way of the train, and to prevent anyone from entering the area around the tracks, and the City of Berkeley signed off on the fence design. This fence was the second to encircle an area formerly occupied by FTCFTH: the first was the metal fence installed by USPS at the Berkeley Main Post Office. Many viewed this fence as symbolically and practically dangerous. <br> <br> The fence was also costly: the SF Chronicle reported in February of 2018 that the total cost was $120,000. Housed residents of Lorin were similarly unhappy with the fence. “BART fenced it [the camp] off with a fence that would not be in North Berkeley or in the hills,” says Miss Richie. “They would not put that unsightly fence there.”',

The fence communicated that this land’s only acceptable use was to buffer the tracks, delineating distance between BART and the surrounding community. This message contradicted the “HERETHERE” sculpture, a piece of public art paid for by the City of Berkeley, and presumably intended to welcome the public. As many articles and public statements have observed, the fence surrounding the installation significantly obscures the letters. <br> <br> In fact, the artist responsible for the installation has publicly criticized the fence in multiple interviews. Steve Gillman called the fence “a very Trumpian move by BART.” Talking to Street Spirit, Gillman said of the fence “It separates the work rather than allowing it to be a part of the rest of the world. And so it has completely changed. The piece is no longer what it was intended to be, it is no longer what Berkeley bought.” There can be no doubt in campers’ minds that the fence exists as a condemnation of the Here / There camp, physically marking the space that the camp once was and can never be again, at least without harsh resistance from BART. <br> <br> Steve Gillman and others spoke up to express their frustration with the fence at a City Council Meeting on January 23, 2018. At the time, Ben Bartlett, a Berkeley Councilmember, stated that “affirmative measures” were being taken to remove the “prison-style fence.” Councilmembers Ben Bartlett and Cheryl Davila co-sponsored an agenda item to remove the fence, which Bartlett went on to call “ugly,” “depressing,” and “unnecessary.” A group of neighbors started a petition to remove the fence and replace it with a playground on the site. As of February 2022, the fence remains.',

One significant outcome from the Old City Hall offshoot of FTCFTH camp was a visit from Leilani Farha, UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing. Farha came to the camp in January 2018 and spoke with Mike Zint and FTCFTH lawyer EmilyRose Johns about the organization’s purpose and its experiences of eviction. During the same trip, Farha visited camps in Oakland and San Francisco. The UN Rapporteur went on to publish a report describing how Bay Area cities were violating the human rights of unhoused people. The report described the conditions that camps like Here / There and Old City Hall are forced to endure as cruel and inhumane. <br> <br> About a week after the Old City Hall offshoot camp was evicted in February, the Berkeley Homeless Commission recommended that the City of Berkeley “provide the First They Came for the Homeless encampment with a location for a tent city which will not be subject to removal absent a major legal violation by the entire encampment community.” FTCFTH had been calling for a sanctioned encampment from its inception, and this recommendation was a meaningful acknowledgement of the validity of the group’s demands. This recommendation was agenda item ‘38a’ at a Berkeley City Council meeting on February 13, 2018. This particular agenda item reportedly sparked a long and spirited debate, but ultimately did not move forward -- a tale as old as time.',

This policy banned all objects on sidewalks in residential districts, with the exception of small cushions and blankets, wheelchairs or other mobility devices, and items that are for sale or ‘in transit.’ The new policy was co-authored by Mayor Jesse Arreguín and city council members Sophie Hahn and Linda Maio. Berkeleyside reported that Hanh insisted that the new regulations would be ‘low priority’ for enforcement. The policy gave enforcement officers (generally public works or code enforcement unit staff) the ability to order people to have all items within a 9-square-foot area. Enforcers could also take objects from the site and place them in storage, as long as a 24-hour warning had been given. Citations could be given to those who refused to remove their belongings. Some council members questioned the morality and practicality of issuing citations to those who could not reasonably be expected to pay them. Speakers from the community came to the council meeting to voice their disapproval, and describe why this new regulation represented a further criminalization of poverty in Berkeley. Despite the assurances that this ordinance would be ‘low priority,’ its passage would lead to future actions taken against unhoused individuals and camps in Berkeley.',

One notable outcome from this camp was its solar arrays, which were recognized in an article for local Bay Area publication The Mercury News. Sam helped create solar panel systems at each of the three new Here / There camps following the BART eviction notice. Implementing solar systems allowed camps to be more self-sufficient, as residents could charge necessary electronic devices without leaving camp to go to coffee shops or libraries. At its height, the solar arrays at the three camps had a combined total output of 2,080 watts, and provided power to around forty people. <br> <br> Residents of the evicted Old City Hall camp were forced to move along yet again. Some joined the Aquatic Park camp, while others returned to the smaller camp that had stayed at the Here / There site. For months, Aquatic Park effectively functioned like any other FTCFTH camp, abiding by the fundamental rules of sobriety and consensus. The Aquatic Park site began to grow beyond the initial group of FTCFTH members, experiencing an influx of population. Over time, the population of the camp nearly doubled from the original 10 or 15 members to 25 people. By some accounts, individuals outside the original group began selling drugs and allowing conditions to deteriorate. The core group of FTCFTH members tried to maintain order and consensus governance, but over time, the group’s ability to enforce rules eroded. Troublesome outsiders kicked out by FTCFTH would routinely return to the camp, disregarding consensus decisions. Conditions continued to worsen, and FTCFTH could not maintain the governance process as outsiders began to dump trash near the camp — attracting rats, creating public health concerns, and drawing the attention of the City of Berkeley.',

                description: 'On November 29, 2018, the City posted an eviction notice for Aquatic Park, citing a violation of the law that prohibits lodging on public property. In December, the City of Berkeley evicted the camp, dismantling all remaining structures and destroying all possessions left behind. This eviction occurred after a landmark case called <i>Martin v. Boise</i>. In this case, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (which holds jurisdiction over nine states, including California) ruled that cities cannot enforce anti-camping laws unless they have an adequate number of shelter beds for the impacted population. In accordance with <i>Martin v. Boise</i>, Berkeley provided the Aquatic Park camp with 27 vouchers for shelter beds at the Dorothy Day House Shelter in the Veteran’s Building. Mike Zint speculated that the City of Berkeley was consciously maintaining shelter vacancies for the purpose of justifying evictions. If the city held onto a number of shelter vacancies comparable to the size of one camp, it could legally evict a camp at any time. Only one of the 27 vouchers was accepted. <br> <br> Often, when camps are evicted and residents are offered shelter vouchers, they are forced to accept strict rules and abandon necessary possessions that cannot be taken in. Even more restrictive are the shelter occupation limits, which often range from one to 30 nights. Though shelters can provide a reprieve from the elements, residents are often unable to secure permanent housing during their stays, and end up returning to the street without the vital possessions discarded to abide by shelter restrictions. As with any eviction, the closing of the Aquatic Park camp caused chaos and panic for residents, and left many without solid options for shelter. A few residents returned to the Here / There camp, which was now located closer to the sidewalk on Adeline Street, outside the fence.',

                description: 'In 2019, the last of the cases heard by Judge Alsup concerning FTCFTH came to a close. In May, a federal jury trial was held to determine whether the City of Berkeley had violated the 1st, 4th, and / or 14th amendment rights of FTCFTH. Adam Brendenberg, Benjamin Royer, and Clark Sullivan were plaintiffs, and sought damages for the city’s seizure and loss of their personal belongings during police raids. FTCFTH alleged that the City of Berkeley had unfairly targeted the group because of its explicitly political nature. The plaintiffs and others who testified during the trial described how police raids separated them from necessary possessions, including medical equipment. The City insisted that it had given ample notice prior to evictions, provided storage for valuable items, and removed camps using minimal force. The City, however, was unable to produce copies of the notices it had posted, and claimed the documents had been ‘wiped’ after the employee handling these records retired. On May 24, 2019, <a href="https://www.berkeleyside.org/2019/05/24/jury-finds-berkeley-did-not-violate-a-homeless-groups-civil-rights" target="_blank" style="color: red">the trial came to a close</a>, and the jury decided that FTCFTH had not been unduly targeted by the city, or had belongings confiscated or eliminated without notice. This verdict ended a case that was originally filed in October 2017, at the same time as the case relating to the BART eviction notice.',

Tim pruned, mulched, and nursed the trees to health. <br> <br> “I wanted to start the garden at the camp very gradually. I had some fear too, about the contamination of the soil, but moreover I had a sense that if I garden in the camp it might be . . .

He works with existing plants like the bottlebrush trees and even the vigorous Bermuda grass. Today, the garden is thriving: there is an abundance of native flowers, fruit trees, leafy vegetables, legumes, medicinal herbs, and so much more. Former camp members continue to have garden days at the camp.',

                description: 'The Here / There camp received another eviction notice on March 6, 2020, after remaining at this site for nearly three years. The posted notice claimed that the camp was in violation of Penal Code 647e, which prohibits ‘lodging on public property.’ The notice read “The City prefers not to have to resort to citation or arrest to gain your compliance with this notice.” The notice also claimed that all members of the encampment were offered vouchers for shelter beds, but Street Spirit Editor in Chief and journalist Alastair Boone reported that residents who contacted the shelter were told that it was full. This notice came just a few days after a car swerved off of Adeline Street and hit the camp, damaging solar panels and tents. The resident of the destroyed tent was, fortunately, not at the camp at the time of the collision. Later in the day on March 6, the city manager (who initially made the decision to evict the camp) reversed the order. Local activist JP Massar alleged that Mayor Arreguín opposed the decision to evict the camp. At the time, it was reported that the city would be installing k-rails at the camp to protect against any future collisions, but as of 2022, no rails have been installed.',

Conversations with former residents shed further light on the camp’s manifold successes, and the tremendous importance of stability in enabling better outcomes for unhoused people. Beyond this stability, the camp was instrumental to several former residents securing housing. In fact, many have framed the camp as a form of transitional housing, an important stop along the journey from street homelessness to housing.',

It’s a step process, the people have decided.” <br> <br> “There are very different ways to do this step process, but what social services are incredibly inept at, is getting someone living in the doorway to another process. What they are very good at doing to a person living in the doorway is shoo-ing them to the next jurisdiction –– that is the homeless policy as it exists. You don’t see people going from doorways to the shelter. They’ll go from medical office to a shelter. They’ll go from a doorway to medical office to a shelter. They’ll go from doorway to homeless encampment to shelter. But they’re not going to go from doorway to a shelter. And the shelter isn’t really set up for that person either.

For some, that success took the form of full time housing. For others, it was gaining a greater sense of wellbeing and agency. The immense struggles that residents faced when they entered the camp were varied and highly personal, but in many cases, the atmosphere of the camp afforded an opportunity to confront and address traumas, instability, discrimination, and a wide range of other issues. Striking the requisite balance between protest movement and support system is a challenge that is difficult to fully express, and the camp’s success in doing so is a testament to the brilliance and tenacity of its residents.',

He has done an amazing amount of work. He completely handled all of the work. He did all the paperwork for me, I did nothing because I cannot deal with paperwork. I have like an attorney or I have a doctor help me fill out paperwork but I do not do paperwork. So Joe is the pivot, the point man on the housing, and he said he was going to house me and I just could not believe that he was going to be able to do it, and so I did not really think that he would come through with it, so when he did it was a real shocker.

I’m currently in the house right now, and it’s going well. It’s a different scene, but a lot of things remind me to not take things for granted. There were times when I was outside, it would take so much energy to just wash up in the morning, go shower, even pee. You get ready, especially if it rains. When rain’s coming, you have to prepare for it, make sure you have empty bottles you can relieve in, or do hygiene, wash up, empty out your trash, things like that. So now, I just get up, and the bathroom’s just right there. It feels kind of nice: at the same time, there are times when I feel like “do I even deserve this?” This is my thought: I think this is one of the reasons why organizers put in a lot of work, because they want to feel that the privilege that they have, especially unhoused advocates that are inside, it’s worth it, like they deserve it, because of the work they’re putting in. I think I kind of got the sense of that, a bit.”',
